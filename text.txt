Product Certification

Why Product Certification is Important:
- A product's certification indicates that it is safe and trustworthy. It serves as a barometer of product quality and a guide for finding reputable manufacturers. Risk can be reduced and minimized by reputable companies. Their commitment to quality and safety is demonstrated by product certification.

KSA Certification (SABER, eCosma & Faseh):
- SABER:
  - Exporting Your Products to Saudi Arabia? Let Us Help You Get Your SASO Quality Mark And SABER Certificate. The Saudi government and relevant authorities have set some regulatory standards to ensure that the products exported from different industries across the world into the country meet the standard mark for safety and quality. Your products must be registered with the Saudi Standards, Metrology, and Quality Organization (SASO) and conform to the technical regulations for the exported goods.
- eCosma & Faseh:
  - Applicable for Cosmetics and Personal Care Products. COC for Cosmetics and Food exports to the Kingdom.

UAE Product Certification:
- Product Registration in Dubai Municipality:
